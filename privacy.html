<h1>Privacy Policy for DealPal</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
DealPal is a browser extension designed to help users track product prices on
Amazon, Walmart, and eBay product detail pages.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
DealPal does <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as
names, email addresses, location data, financial information, or authentication credentials.
</p>

<p>
When a user clicks the <strong>Scan</strong> button, DealPal temporarily reads limited
information from the currently open product page, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product title</li>
  <li>Product price</li>
  <li>Product page URL</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is used solely to allow the user to track prices over time.
</p>

<h2>How Data Is Stored</h2>

<p>
All tracked product information is stored <strong>locally in the user’s browser</strong>
using Chrome’s storage API. DealPal does not transmit this data to any external servers.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
DealPal does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.
Any optional references to anonymized data sharing within the extension interface
are informational only and are not currently active.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
DealPal may include outbound links to third-party services such as Amazon through
affiliate links or to Ko-fi for optional donations. Interaction with these services
is governed by their respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
This privacy policy may be updated in the future if DealPal adds new functionality.
Any changes will be reflected on this page.
</p>
